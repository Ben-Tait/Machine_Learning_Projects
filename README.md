# Machine Learning Projects 

A collection of Machine Learning projects and notebooks built while learning ML concepts — covering regression, classification, clustering, and more. Each project is implemented in Python using Google Colab.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python** — core programming language
- **pandas** — data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** — numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** — data visualization
- **scikit-learn** — machine learning models and utilities
- **Google Colab** — development environment
